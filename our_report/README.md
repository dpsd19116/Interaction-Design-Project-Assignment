# Introduction

# Summary


# 1st Deliverable
Brief:We are going to desing a led lamp that activates the led lights when the room is dark enought.Also the led lights will change colors depending the mood.

Reasearch: 
1)Analyse people:The main target group will be people that want an inconventional lamp.

2)Define activities: Before our project the users had to turn on the lights by themselfs. With our project the users dont have to worry about turning on the light because it will open automatically. Also the user will have the oportinity to select the color that they  want depending the situation.

3)Describe context: The context is going to be the living room, bedroom and any room that the user will want to relax.

4)The technologies that we gonna use for the project will be  arduino uno , led light , resistor  , sensor , battery.



# 2nd Deliverable
Information architecture: The look of the lamp will be like a normal lamp but the main difference will on the mechanism undeneath the lamp.

User interaction: The led lamp will  start working when the room starts to become enough dark(the user will decide the ideal darkness when the lamp will turn on). The light color changes will be smooth so the users feel relaxed. Finally the leds will turn off automatically when the brightness of the room stars increasing.

Interface design: The led lights will produce the light. The light dependent resistor will turn on/off the light when it is necessary. The resistor will   reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines. Finally a battery will power the system.
